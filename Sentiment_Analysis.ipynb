The indicator will turn red in a matter of seconds.-This is not a viable machine if you live in a place that is dusty. It is meant for mostly clean houses is rural germany where there is next to no dust, is my impression.-Not at all easy to clean. The only way that removes 70% of the dust collected in the filter is to bang the filter against the floor. Then sweep it up with a broom and pour the dust into a bucket of water so that it won't spread anymore. A very painful process to repeat every 2 minutes of vaccuming.- The filter cannot be washed effectively. So after the 1st few uses it is always at half capacity right from the start.The maintenance of this device is so painful that I regret buying it.

The indicator will turn red in a matter of seconds.-This is not a viable machine if you live in a place that is dusty. It is meant for mostly clean houses is rural germany where there is next to no dust, is my impression.-Not at all easy to clean. The only way that removes 70% of the dust collected in the filter is to bang the filter against the floor. Then sweep it up with a broom and pour the dust into a bucket of water so that it won\\'t spread anymore. A very painful process to repeat every 2 minutes of vaccuming.- The filter cannot be washed effectively. So after the 1st few uses it is always at half capacity right from the start.The maintenance of this device is so painful that I regret buying it.
